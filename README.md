## General Information

The application allows drawing polygons on the screen by designating their vertices. Once a polygon is created the user can modify it and create
relations between pairs of its edges such as equal length or parallel arrangement.

It is one of the projects which I have developed during my studies. Through this project, I could improve my skills with creating applications
with a graphical interface. The project also required solving some algorithmic problems: grabbing vertices and edges properly and repositioning
parts of the polygon appropriately so that the relations between the edges are maintained.

## Setup

To build the project firstly you need to import the project into Visual Studio.

You need to have the Newtonsoft.Json package installed (a popular high-performance JSON framework for .NET).
