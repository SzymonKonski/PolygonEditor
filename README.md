An app with a graphical interface created with Windows Forms (Microsoft .NET Framework) in C#.

The app allows to draw and edit polygons and create relations between their edges.

## General Information

The application allows drawing polygons on the screen by designating their vertices. Once a polygon is created the user can modify it and create
relations between pairs of its edges such as equal length or parallel arrangement.

It is one of the projects which I have developed during my studies. Through this project, I could improve my skills with creating applications
with a graphical interface. The project also required solving some algorithmic problems: grabbing vertices and edges properly and repositioning
parts of the polygon appropriately so that the relations between the edges are maintained.

## Features

- Create multiple polygons by determining positions of their vertices
- Remove a polygon
- Remove a vertex of a polygon
- Add a new vertex in the middle of an edge of an existing polygon
- Move a polygon
- Add a relation of equal lengths of edges between a pair of edges (every time the polygon is modified, the program will try to maintain
the relation)
- Add a relation of parallel arrangement between a pair of edges
- Remove a relation
- Add a predefined polygon
- Export the data about existing polygons and relations in .json format

## Setup

To build the project firstly you need to import the project into Visual Studio.

You need to have the Newtonsoft.Json package installed (a popular high-performance JSON framework for .NET).
